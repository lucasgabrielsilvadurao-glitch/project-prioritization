# project-prioritization
Educational Python project focused on decision-making logic and project prioritization, developed after Python Mundo 1 (Curso em Vídeo).

# Python Mundo 1 – Final Project

This repository contains a final project developed after
completing **Python Mundo 1** from Curso em Vídeo.

The purpose of this project is educational: to consolidate
fundamental Python concepts learned during the course.

## About the Project

The program simulates a simple **project prioritization system**,
inspired by common decision-making processes used in technology
companies.

The user is guided through a structured evaluation of a single
project, considering business-oriented criteria and receiving
a final recommendation based on the analysis.

---

## Methodology

The prioritization is based on a **weighted scoring model**,
commonly used in project and portfolio management.

The following criteria are evaluated on a scale from 1 to 5:

- Business impact  
- Required effort  
- Estimated cost  
- Associated risk  

Higher impact increases priority, while higher effort, cost,
and risk reduce it.

## Technologies and Concepts

- Python 3
- Variables and input/output
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Basic string formatting
- Terminal styling with ANSI colors
- Simple decision-making logic

---

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

```bash
python projeto-final-mundo01.py
